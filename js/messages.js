On this special day dedicated to you, I want to express my deepest gratitude for everything you've done for us. Your passion for teaching, patience in guiding us and belief in our potential have shaped not just our knowledge but also our future. What I am today , in my second innings ( After full coloured service in Indian Army ) , SVP n Head , NCR &North , Yes Vijay, Yes Bank , is a direct consequence of grooming under the finest hands , in Graphic Era. In that , I would like to make a special mention of
Prof Ghanshala , Hon‚Äôble Chairman , Uttarakhand Ratan- A visionary leader, epitome of inspiration himself  .. He is a live example , that dreams are nobody‚Äôs monopoly  .. No less than Mukesh Ambani , in my view.. He is an example that gives hope that anybody can dream big and achieve them  , with dedication and smart work .. Of course , every body cannot be Prof Ghanshala , but then there is no embargo also .. And you must have a wife , like Mrs Ghanshala , who supports your dreams .. This is a necessary condition .. But that is luck, pure luck 
Prof Rawat  ‚Äì A teacher par excellence , who had made my life misrable and it was an every day affair, no respite.  Thank you , Prof Rawat , Your impact goes beyond classrooms and textbooks; you've helped us transition from War rooms to Board rooms , successfully and with elan 
Happy Teachers' Day!
