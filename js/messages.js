In my life, I have met many people who told me, ‚ÄúBhaiya, you are my inspiration‚Äù or ‚ÄúSir, you are my inspiration.‚Äù But the most important thing is who is my inspiration?
It is the person who transformed an ordinary child into someone people admire and consider their inspiration. And that person is none other than my guide, Dr. Prabh Deep Singh Sir.
You know the saying, "If you immerse yourself in fragrance, you too will start smelling sweet"‚Äîthat‚Äôs exactly what happened to me. He is someone loved by everyone, and if you stay with him, walk the path he shows, you too will become like him one day.

    text: `Dear Professors

On this special day dedicated to you, I want to express my deepest gratitude for everything you've done for us. Your passion for teaching, patience in guiding us and belief in our potential have shaped not just our knowledge but also our future. What I am today , in my second innings ( After full coloured service in Indian Army ) , SVP n Head , NCR &North , Yes Vijay, Yes Bank , is a direct consequence of grooming under the finest hands , in Graphic Era. In that , I would like to make a special mention of
Prof Ghanshala , Hon‚Äôble Chairman , Uttarakhand Ratan- A visionary leader, epitome of inspiration himself  .. He is a live example , that dreams are nobody‚Äôs monopoly  .. No less than Mukesh Ambani , in my view.. He is an example that gives hope that anybody can dream big and achieve them  , with dedication and smart work .. Of course , every body cannot be Prof Ghanshala , but then there is no embargo also .. And you must have a wife , like Mrs Ghanshala , who supports your dreams .. This is a necessary condition .. But that is luck, pure luck 
Prof Rawat  ‚Äì A teacher par excellence , who had made my life misrable and it was an every day affair, no respite.  Thank you , Prof Rawat , Your impact goes beyond classrooms and textbooks; you've helped us transition from War rooms to Board rooms , successfully and with elan 
Happy Teachers' Day!

In classrooms bright with dreams and light,
You guided me through day and night.
With patience, wisdom, and a steady hand,
You helped me see, to understand.

Each lesson more than books could say,
You shaped my mind in every way.
Your words still guide my every start,
They‚Äôve found a home within my heart.

Though time has flown, and paths have grown wide,
Your teachings walk right by my side.
For all you‚Äôve given, all you‚Äôve done,

No voice to rise, no dream to call.
Through life I walked, unsure, alone,
A seed unwatered, never grown.

Then came a guide, so pure, so kind,
Who lit the lamps within my mind.
With every word, with every smile,
He taught me dreams are worth the while.

Like flowers bloom in morning‚Äôs hue,
He shaped my soul, my courage too.
From dust to gold, from night to day,
He showed me love will light the way.

If fragrance clings to those who care,
It‚Äôs 'cause their goodness lingers there.
Dr. Prabh Deep Singh‚Äîmy guiding star,
Who made me see how bright we are.

From zero‚Äôs shell, I‚Äôve found my flight,
All thanks to him who gave me light.

In every lecture, day by day.
Equations, circuits, gears that spin,
Yet lessons deeper lie within.

You showed us how to think, not just to do,
To chase each problem, see it through.
When logic failed, you lit the spark,
And guided us through paths so dark.

In bridges built of code and steel,
You taught the strength of what we feel‚Äî
That curiosity fuels the mind,
And kindness leaves the best designs behind.

So here we stand, with dreams anew,
The blueprints drawn because of you.
A teacher, mentor, and engineer,
Whose wisdom keeps our futures clear."

First step in college, a little unsure,
Shipra Ma‚Äôam, your lessons opened the door.
Your voice turned fear to eager delight,
You made the first semester truly bright.

Yachna Ma‚Äôam, with laughter and grace,
Tests I feared, but free time was ace.
Your warmth made every moment new,
A teacher, a friend, I thank you.

Devika Ma‚Äôam, sweetest soul of the lot,
In every line, your kindness I caught.
You made literature feel like a song,
Guiding us gently, carrying us along.

Amar Sir, still a mentor today,
Your wisdom shaped my professional way.
From first mail correction to lessons profound,
Your guidance is where my strength is found.

Anshu Ma‚Äôam, your ‚ÄúYOU‚Äù gave us fear,
But your ‚ÄúHMM‚Äù brought the answers near.
I cherished each class, challenge and all,
With you, I learned to never stall.

Arpita Ma‚Äôam, though you‚Äôve moved away,
Your kindness and maturity still stay.
Thank you for Hackathon and every smile,
You made the journey worthwhile.

And Vipin Sir, our guiding star,
Always supportive, you raised the bar.
For standing with us through every tide,
Thank you for walking by our side.

To all my mentors, near or far,
You shaped who I am, you lit my star."
